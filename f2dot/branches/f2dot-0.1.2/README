The source files are Python scripts which have the following
dependencies:
 * a Python interpreter (python >= 2.7)
 * the GraphViz toolset with the pygraphviz library
 * (optional) XDot, or any DOT vizualizer for visualizing .dot files

The project can be distributed with toolsets like pyinstaller
(http://www.pyinstaller.org/) or distutils
(https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/)

The program usage is displayed running the script 'f2dot' with the
argument '-h' with a python interpreter:

$ python f2dot -h
