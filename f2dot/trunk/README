\b f2dot is a software tool developed as part of the <a
href="https://forsyde.ict.kth.se/trac/">ForSyDe</a> (Formal System
Design) project. The name stands for "ForSyDe-2-DOT" and enables
plotting ForSyDe-XML models into DOT graphs. For more information,
check the <a
href="https://forsyde.ict.kth.se/trac/wiki/ForSyDe/f2dot">tool's wiki
page</a>

The source files are Python scripts which have the following
dependencies: 
 - a Python interpreter (python >= 2.7)
 - the GraphViz toolset with the <a
   href="http://pygraphviz.github.io/">pygraphviz</a> library
 - (optional) XDot, or any DOT vizualizer for visualizing \c .dot
   files

The project can be distributed with toolsets like pyinstaller
<a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/">pyinstaller</a> or

The program usage is displayed calling the runner script \c f2dot with
the argument \c -h with a python interpreter:

 \code 
python f2dot -h
\endcode */


Version history 
---------------

f2dot-0.1.2
 * added the option to customize which processes to be clustered by
   the main parser (changes in the logic of the code)
 * fixed vector/array/tuple signals bug
 * added full support for XPath queries by including py-dom-xpath
   library (https://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/) -- MIT License
 * coded the parser methods to extract queries which return both
   node-sets and unicode values. Thus, one can write custom labels
   (names) through appropriate XPath queries and write node tags or
   attribute names instead of just attribute values 
 * changed the project structure to align to python distribution
   conventions
 * gave up the C++-like class inheritance topology, since it is not
   relevant for this project. Thus new parsers can be built now as
   separate packages (with different names), which include everything
   from the parsemethods package.
 * added doxygen comments and a doxfile

f2dot-0.1.1
 * fixed path and config bugs
 * added custom ID separator to overcome name clashes
 * edges now use compass directions for head and tail ports
 * input and output ports are clustered together

f2dot-0.1.0
 * ForSyDe model plotter
 * customizable through command-line arguments or config file
 * recursive parsing of multiple ForSyDe-XML files generated by
   ForSyDe-SystemC and building DOT graphs using different algorithms
   (see -h)
